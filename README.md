The gym management system has several functionalities that facilitate the administration and organization of the gym. Let's discuss each functionality in detail:

1. Member Registration: This functionality allows new individuals to register as members of the gym. They can provide their personal information such as name, contact details, address, and any other required details. This information is typically stored in a database for future reference.

2. Admin Login: This functionality enables authorized administrators to access the system by entering their login credentials, such as username and password. Once logged in, administrators can perform various administrative tasks and access privileged features.

3. Delete Member: With this functionality, the administrators have the ability to remove a member from the gym system. They can search for a specific member using their unique identifier (e.g., membership number, name, or other identifying information) and then delete their record from the database. This feature is useful when a member cancels their membership or if there are any other reasons for removal.

4. List of All Members: This functionality provides a comprehensive list of all registered members of the gym. Administrators can view this list, which typically includes member details such as names, contact information, membership status, and any other relevant information. It helps the administrators keep track of all active members and their respective details.

5. Log Out: This functionality allows administrators to securely log out from the system when they have finished their session. By logging out, they ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot access the administrative features and data.

6. Exit: The "Exit" functionality allows the administrators to close the gym management system completely. It terminates the program and ends the session. This feature is useful when administrators want to shut down the system or switch to other tasks.

Overall, the gym management system provides an interface for member registration, facilitates administrative tasks such as member deletion and listing, and ensures secure access through admin login. These functionalities enhance the overall efficiency and organization of the gym's operations.
